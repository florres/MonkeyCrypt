Hill Cipher

The key to the Hill cipher is a matrix, which must be completely filled with a character of the alphabet.

When you encrypt, a matrix is created from the input text. It may be that the encrypted output contains some characters in addition. To ensure a successful decryption these additional characters should not be deleted.

Characters that are not contained in the alphabet are not encrypted.

The Hill cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution.
