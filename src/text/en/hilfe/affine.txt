Affine cipher

The Affine cipher has two keys, a and b.
Both are a character of the alphabet.


a should be coprime to the length of the alphabet.
It is possible to generate a random coprime key.
All keys are coprime to an alphabet, if its length is prime.


Characters, which are not part of the alphabet, won't be encrypted.


The affine cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution.
