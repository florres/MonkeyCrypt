        I am

      Excellent! As you can see in the Caesar encryption one
      Letter is always replaced with exactly one other. That is why this
      Process as monoalphabetic substitution. You can replace it
      by writing down the normal alphabet, and
      including a comma</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span
      style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"> Buchstaben&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span
      style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">commenced and appropriately
      is continued. This first
      Letter is then the "key" of the secret.<br>

      This is a Caesar disk. The plaintext is outside

      You always see the key below the plain text "A".
      If you press the [or the] arrow [e], it changes
      the key.<br>

      Basteltipp: So you can even make a Caesar-disk: prints
      under [print] of the document [Caesar-disk]. Glue that
      Sheet on a piece of cardboard and cut the two slices
      then carefully. Place the two slices on a cork
      and fasten them with a tear in their center.
      The Caesar discs are finished! You always see the key

      Arrow [e], the key changes.<br>
