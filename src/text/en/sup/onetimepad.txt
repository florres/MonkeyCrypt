One-Time Pad

The key of the One-Time-Pad is a string consisting of characters of the alphabet.

The key should be as long as the input string.
A random key of this exact length can be generated.
Randomly generated keys are more secure.

Characters, which are not part of the alphabet, are not encrypted.

One-Time-Pad is a polyalphabetic cipher.
