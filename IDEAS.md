Ideas for MonkeyCrypt
=====================

**GUI**
+ add an interactive vigenere-square that highlights the column and row you're clicking on.
+ Less compact UI
+ Resizable/responsive GUI
+ Move to JavaFX for a richer UX
+ Add a drag and move functionality instead of clicking on the arrows for rotating the wheel

**Cryptography**
+ add the enigma as encryption / decryption
+ add functions that make cracking codes easier
+ add a section with user defined cryptography functions
+ add comparison of time needed to break encryption
+ add timeline of popular encryption schemas and their relevance
+ add password strength measurement functionality to estimate time to crack

**Other stuff**
+ translate the program in other languages
+ add build instructions
+ Code examples in python
+ Set MonkeyCrypt icon as the app icon instead of the default java applet icon
+ Pseudo-intelligent assistive agent similar to clippy for Microsoft Office 2003/2007 that helps children to get hints.
+ Put some examples in the help section for each cipher (ex. In Caesar's cipher it would be much easier to understand if a word like 'CAESAR' is converted to corresponding cipher text).
